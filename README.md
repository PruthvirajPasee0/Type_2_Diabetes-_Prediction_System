#Type 2 Diabetes Prediction System
**Accurately Predict Diabetes with AI!**

This **Type 2 Diabetes Prediction System** is a **Flask-powered machine learning web app** which predicts the risk of diabetes based on principal health indicators. Developed using **Python, Flask, and Logistics Regression**, this project combines **data visualization (Matplotlib, NumPy)** with an **easy-to-use web interface** to generate speedy, accurate predictions.

### Features

✅ **AI-Based Predictions** – Employs the XGBoost model to provide high-accuracy outputs.
✅ **Web Interface with Ease of Use** – Minimal input fields to facilitate easy input.
✅ **Real-Time Output** – Immediate predictions with a clear **Diabetic/Non-Diabetic** output.
✅ **Data-Informed Insights** – Matplotlib plots for easier data interpretation.
✅ **Optimized Backend** – Flask-based API with an optimized prediction pipeline.

### Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Flask, NumPy, Joblib  
- **Machine Learning:** Logistics Regression
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Integrated into Flask templates)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib
